    Allow Coordinator compiled targetting .Net 2.0 to run on .Net 4.0+ only environments.
  
    Use supportedRuntime tags to explicitly specify the version(s) of the .NET Framework runtime 
    that the AppDynamics Coordinator service should run on. If no versions are specified, the 
    chosen version of the runtime will be the "best" match to what 
    AppDynamics.Coordinator.exe was built against.

    WARNING: leaving the version unspecified is dangerous as it introduces a risk of compatibility
    problems with future versions of the .NET Framework runtime. It is highly recommended that you 
    specifyonly the version(s) of the .NET Framework runtime that you have tested against.

    Note for .NET Framework v3.0 and v3.5, the runtime version is still v2.0.

    In order to enable .NET Framework version 2.0 runtime activation policy, which is to load all 
    assemblies by using the latest supported runtime, @useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true".

    For more information, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bbx34a2h.aspx
